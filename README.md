# CoWorkers VS Code Extension

This extension builds upon Cloudflare Workers AI to offer AI-generated code
suggestions in VS Code. The extension is very rudimentary and should not be
expected to return suggestions on the same caliber as commercially-available
products. 

## How to Install
1. Download the latest .vsix from the Releases tab of this repo.
2. Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view. (Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-X)
3. Click on the three dots in the top right corner, then click "Install from VSIX..."
4. Reload your workspace. A settings pane should automatically open with extension settings highlighted. 
5. Set your Cloudflare account ID and Workers AI API token in the settings pane. 

## Settings
You can edit the extension settings at any time by going into VS Code Settings
and searching for "CoWorkers".
